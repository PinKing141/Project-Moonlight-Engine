# Project Moonlight Backlog

Purpose: Capture feature ideas discovered during playtesting without violating the implementation freeze.

## Rules
- Do not implement backlog items during the current playtest/balance cycle.
- Only bug fixes, maintenance, and approved roadmap scope are allowed.
- Promote an item into code only by opening a new roadmap section (e.g., V15) with explicit tasks and exit gates.
